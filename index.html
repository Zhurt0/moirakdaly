            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>I am currently an Associate Professor at the Department of Economics, Copenhagen Business School and a member of the 2023 CBS Leadership Thinktank.</p>
            
            <p>After earning my undergraduate degree in Economics, I spent some time in the corporate world before finding my way back to academia. I started on this path by pursuing a Master's in Applied Statistics at Villanova University. It was during this time that I discovered my love for teaching and the intellectual freedom that a research environment offers. I subsequently began a Ph.D. program in Economics from Boston University.</p>
            
            <p>After earning my Ph.D., I joined the Copenhagen Business School as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics. Following a maternity leave, I served as a Senior Advisor at the Center for Economic Research. I am now delighted to be back in academia as an Associate Professor of Economics at CBS where I continue to pursue my research interests and teaching.</p>
            
            <p>In addition to my corporate and academic experience, I credit my 15+ years of waitressing, cooking, and managing in the food service industry for preparing me to work under pressure, multitask, and handle the various personalities I encounter in academia, both in and outside of the classroom.</p>

        <div class="content" id="research">
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>My research sits at the intersection of labor economics, entrepreneurship, and organizational leadership, examining how individuals and organizations navigate career choices and digital transformation. I study how educational choices, family background, and gender shape pathways into entrepreneurship and leadership roles, while also investigating how leaders influence organizational decisions around technology adoption, innovation, and rent-sharing. A particular focus of my work is understanding skill utilization and development in an increasingly digital labor market. My research employs rigorous empirical methods to provide new insights into these interconnected economic phenomena. I hope to contribute to our understanding of how institutional, technological, and personal factors shape economic outcomes and career trajectories in modern labor markets.</p>
