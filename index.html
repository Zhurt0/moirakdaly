            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>I am currently an Associate Professor at the Department of Economics, Copenhagen Business School and a member of the 2023 CBS Leadership Thinktank.</p>
            
            <p>After earning my undergraduate degree in Economics, I spent some time in the corporate world before finding my way back to academia. I started on this path by pursuing a Master's in Applied Statistics at Villanova University. It was during this time that I discovered my love for teaching and the intellectual freedom that a research environment offers. I subsequently began a Ph.D. program in Economics from Boston University.</p>
            
            <p>After earning my Ph.D., I joined the Copenhagen Business School as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics. Following a maternity leave, I served as a Senior Advisor at the Center for Economic Research. I am now delighted to be back in academia as an Associate Professor of Economics at CBS where I continue to pursue my research interests and teaching.</p>
            
            <p>In addition to my corporate and academic experience, I credit my 15+ years of waitressing, cooking, and managing in the food service industry for preparing me to work under pressure, multitask, and handle the various personalities I encounter in academia, both in and outside of the classroom.</p>
